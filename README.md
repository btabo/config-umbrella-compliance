# config-umbrella-compliance

This repository contains the custom scripts for CI, CD, and CC pipelines for the Umbrella subsystem.
It assumes that you are familiar with [OnePipeline](https://pages.github.ibm.com/one-pipeline/docs).
It is not intended for reuse. Thus its document is and will remain sparse. Rather it can be used as an example for other OnePipeline adopters.

Entry points are:
- [CI pipeline](ci/.one-pipeline.yaml)
- [CD pipeline](cd/.one-pipeline.yaml)
- [CC pipeline](cc/.one-pipeline.yaml)
